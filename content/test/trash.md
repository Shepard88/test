![missing image](/images/hangingkike.jpg)

above is probably a missing image, if you check the markdown, that's how you auto embed an image that would be kept in the static/images/ directory from your main web folder.
Just add a hangingkike.jpg to that directory and it should appear here.


To add a bold line just do *this*.
For italics just do **this**, or for both, ***this***.


note that each new paragraph you want will have to be created from a double space.


you can also use direct html in markdown and it'll work just fine, in case you're insane and want to do stuff like <strong>this</strong>


it is useful for adding custom stuff that markdown doesn't have by default though, like if you need a certain sort of class in there.
One example is that I made my own figure caption class for images in it since there's no default markdown behaviour for that.


you can also link to other sites like [this](https://gohugo.io/)


there are also other cool things like embedding youtube that I won't show here.
